        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>
            We are passionate about using technology to solve real-world problems. Our flood prediction system uses artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to analyze rainfall and weather data, helping communities prepare for floods.
        </p>
        <h3>How the Data is Trained</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>We collected historical flood and rainfall data for different regions.</li>
            <li>We trained a machine learning model to recognize patterns in the data that signal flood risk.</li>
            <li>The model was integrated into this website, so anyone can enter new weather data and get instant flood risk predictions.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            AI-driven flood prediction is transforming disaster preparedness worldwide, making our communities safer and more resilient.<br>
            <em>Inspired by real-world platforms using AI for flood forecasting and risk mitigation.</em>
